description: 'Checks the sizes of the watchdog collections'
help: >-
  This command produces a list of the sizes of the watchdog capped collections,
  grouped by "bucket". The bucket sizes are 0 (empty collection), 1 (single
  document), one bucket for each fraction of the size of the capping limit
  (which should be the typical case), one for capping limit - 1, and one for the
  capping limit itself, showing events occurring too often for the configured
  limit.

  For example: with a typical capping limit of 10000, the list will be made of
  the following buckets: 0, 1, 2-1000, 1001-2000, 2001-3000, ... 9000-9998,
  9999, and 10000.
